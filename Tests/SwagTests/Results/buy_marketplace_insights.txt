You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, or a combination of these. This method also supports the following: Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter. Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item , such as item aspects (color, brand), condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter. Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter. Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match.

		/// (Limited Release) This method searches for sold eBay items by various URI query parameters and retrieves the sales history of the items for the last 90 days. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, or a combination of these. This method also supports the following: Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter. Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item , such as item aspects (color, brand), condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter. Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter. Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/ Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this method.

		/// <param name="aspect_filter">This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red. The results are returned in the refinement container. For example, the method below uses the category ID for Women's Clothing. This will return only sold items for a woman's red or blue shirt. /buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=shirt&amp;category_ids=15724&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red|Blue} To get a list of the aspects pairs and the category, which is returned in the dominantCategoryId field, set fieldgroups to ASPECT_REFINEMENTS. /buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=shirt&amp;category_ids=15724&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Format: aspectName:{value1|value2} Required: The category ID is required twice; once as a URI parameter and as part of the aspect_filter parameter. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/marketplace_insights/types/AspectFilter.html</param>
		/// <param name="category_ids">The category ID is required and is used to limit the results. For example, if you search for 'shirt' the result set will be very large. But if you also include the category ID 137084, the results will be limited to 'Men's Athletic Apparel'. For example: /buy/marketplace-insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=shirt&amp;category_ids=137084 The list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. You can use the following techniques to find a category by site: For the US marketplace, use the Category Changes page. Use the Taxonomy API. For details see Get Categories for Buy APIs. Usage: This field can have one category ID or a comma separated list of IDs. You can use category_ids by itself or use it with any combination of the gtin, epid, and q fields, which gives you additional control over the result set. Restrictions: Partners will be given a list of categories they can use. To use a top-level (L1) category, you must also include the q, or gtin, or epid query parameter. Maximum number of categories: 4</param>
		/// <param name="epid">The ePID is the eBay product identifier of a product from the eBay product catalog. This field limits the results to only items in the specified ePID. /buy/marketplace-insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?epid=241986085&amp;category_ids=168058 You can use the product_summary/search method in the Catalog API to search for the ePID of the product. Required: At least 1 category_ids Maximum: 1 epid Optional: Any combination of epid, gtin, or q</param>
		/// <param name="fieldgroups">This field lets you control what is to be returned in the response and accepts a comma separated list of values. The default is MATCHING_ITEMS, which returns the items that match the keyword or category specified. The other values return data that can be used to create histograms. For code examples see, aspect_filter. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - This returns the aspectDistributions container, which has the dominantCategoryId, matchCount, and refinementHref for the various aspects of the items found. For example, if you searched for 'Mustang', some of the aspect would be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, etc. Note: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS are category specific. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the buyingOptionDistributions container, which has the matchCount and refinementHref for AUCTION and FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items. Note: Classified items are not supported. CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - This returns the categoryDistributions container, which has the categories that the item is in. CONDITION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the conditionDistributions container, such as NEW, USED, etc. Within these groups are multiple states of the condition. For example, New can be New without tag, New in box, New without box, etc. MATCHING_ITEMS - This is meant to be used with one or more of the refinement values above. You use this to return the specified refinements and all the matching items. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default: MATCHING_ITEMS</param>
