For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves monetary transactions 11 thru 20 from the result set. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. If an orderId, transactionId, or payoutId filter is included in the request, any limit value will be ignored. Maximum: 200 Default: 20</param>

So, if you wanted to view the 11th monetary transaction of the result set, you would set the offset value in the request to 10.
