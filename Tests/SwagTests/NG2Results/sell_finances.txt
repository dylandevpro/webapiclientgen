See the filter field for more information on each filter, and how each one is used. There are also pagination and sort query parameters that allow users to further control the monetary transactions that are returned in the response. If no monetary transactions match the input criteria, an http status code of 204 No Content is returned with no response payload.
		 * Get transaction
		 * @param {string} filter Numerous filters are available for the getTransactions method, and these filters are discussed below. One or more of these filter types can be used. If none of these filters are used, all monetary transactions from the last 90 days are returned: transactionDate: search for monetary transactions that occurred within a specific range of dates. The date format to use is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a date range: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionDate:[2018-10-23T00:00:01.000Z..2018-11-09T00:00:01.000Z] Alternatively, the user could omit the ending date, and the date range would include the starting date and up to 90 days past that date, or the current date if the starting date is less than 90 days in the past. transactionType: search for a specific type of monetary transaction. The supported transactionType values are as follows: SALE: a sales order. REFUND: a refund to the buyer after an order cancellation or return. CREDIT: a credit issued by eBay to the seller's account. DISPUTE: a monetary transaction associated with a payment dispute between buyer and seller. SHIPPING_LABEL: a monetary transaction where eBay is billing the seller for an eBay shipping label. Note that the shipping label functionality will initially only be available to a select number of sellers.Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a monetary transaction type: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionType:{SALE} transactionStatus: this filter type is only applicable for sales orders, and allows the user to filter seller payouts in a particular state. The supported transactionStatus values are as follows: PAYOUT: this indicates that the proceeds from the corresponding sales order has been paid out to the seller's account. FUNDS_PROCESSING: this indicates that the funds for the corresponding monetary transaction are currently being processed. FUNDS_AVAILABLE_FOR_PAYOUT: this indicates that the proceeds from the corresponding sales order are available for a seller payout, but processing has not yet begun. FUNDS_ON_HOLD: this indicates that the proceeds from the corresponding sales order are currently being held by eBay, and are not yet available for a seller payout.Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by transaction status: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionStatus:{PAYOUT} buyerUsername: the eBay user ID of the buyer involved in the monetary transaction. Only monetary transactions involving this buyer are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific eBay buyer: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=buyerUsername:{buyer1234} salesRecordReference: the unique Selling Manager identifier of the order involved in the monetary transaction. Only monetary transactions involving this Selling Manager Sales Record ID are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific Selling Manager Sales Record ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=salesRecordReference:{123} Note: For all orders originating after February 1, 2020, a value of 0 will be returned in the salesRecordReference field. So, this filter will only be useful to retrieve orders than occurred before this date.. payoutId: the unique identifier of a seller payout. This value is auto-generated by eBay once the seller payout is set to be processed. Only monetary transactions involving this Payout ID are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific Payout ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=payoutId:{5000106638} transactionId: the unique identifier of a monetary transaction. For a sales order, the orderId filter should be used instead. Only the monetary transaction defined by the identifier is returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific transaction ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionId:{03-03620-33763} orderId: the unique identifier of a sales order. For any other monetary transaction, the, the transactionId filter should be used instead. Only the sales order defined by the identifier is returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific order ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=orderId:{03-03620-33763} For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/finances/types/FilterField.html
		 * @param {string} sort Sorting is not yet available for the getTransactions method. By default, monetary transactions that match the input criteria are sorted in descending order according to the transaction date. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/finances/types/SortField.html
		 * @param {string} limit The number of monetary transactions to return per page of the result set. Use this parameter in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves monetary transactions 11 thru 20 from the result set. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. If an orderId, transactionId, or payoutId filter is included in the request, any limit value will be ignored. Maximum: 200 Default: 20
		 * @param {string} offset This integer value indicates the actual position that the first monetary transaction returned on the current page has in the results set. So, if you wanted to view the 11th monetary transaction of the result set, you would set the offset value in the request to 10. In the request, you can use the offset parameter in conjunction with the limit parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 30 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves transactions 31 thru 40 from the resulting collection of transactions. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. Default: 0 (zero)
